# 🧳 Agentic AI-Based Travel Planning Assistant

## Project Overview
The Agentic AI-Based Travel Planning Assistant is an intelligent travel itinerary generator built using **Python, Streamlit, and Agentic AI concepts**.  
It automatically creates **personalized travel plans** by reasoning like a travel expert while considering **budget, travel duration, and destinations**.

This project demonstrates **Agentic AI behavior**, where an AI agent plans trips by simulating decision-making similar to a human travel consultant.
